Answer 1:-
The relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" is a many-to-one relationship. This is indicated by the line that connects these two entities, 
with the end of the line near "Product" having a 'crow's foot' (representing 'many'),
and the other end near "Product_Category" coming to a single point (representing 'one').
This means that many products can be assigned to one product category, but each product can only have one category assigned to it.

Answer 2:-
To ensure that each product has a valid category, you can enforce referential integrity between the "Product" table and the
"Product_Category" table through a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. The foreign key constraint would ensure that every 
"category_id" in the "Product" table corresponds to a valid "id" in the "Product_Category" table. Additionally, 
you can make the "category_id" column a NOT NULL constraint to ensure that every product must have a category assigned.
